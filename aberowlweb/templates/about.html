<h1>AberOWL</h1>

<p>AberOWL is a framework for ontology-based access to biological data. It
consists of a repository of bio-ontologies, a set of webservices which
provide access to OWL(-EL) reasoning over the ontologies, and several
frontends which utilise the ontology repository and reasoning services
to provide access to specific biological datasets.</p>

<h2>Web Repository</h2>
<p>
  The web-based repository front-end provides many features
  underpinned by reasoned access to ontologies.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Upload and immediate classification of ontologies.</li>
  <li>Semantic querying of ontologies using Manchester OWL
    Syntax.</li>
  <li>Query Pubmed and PubMed central articles using ontology
    terms.</li>
  <li>Ontology-based access to RDF/Linked data through SPARQL
    integration.</li>
</ul>

<h3 class="api">Uploading ontologies</h3>
<p>
  To do this you must first create an account, then fill out the form
  on the <a href="{% url "create_ontology" %}">upload page</a><span>. It is
  probably a good idea to check whether an ontology exists first.
  You can also upload new versions of an existing ontology once you
    have claimed it.</span>
</p>

<h3 class="api">Querying ontologies</h3>
<h4>Class Query</h4>
<p>AberOWL provides semantic access to ontologies. It performs OWL-EL
reasoning over a repository of ontologies using
the <a href="https://code.google.com/p/elk-reasoner/">ELK reasoner</a>
and answers queries over single ontologies or the full AberOWL
ontology repository. Ontologies in AberOWL are identified by their
name, and queries are performed
in <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/owl2-manchester-syntax/">Manchester
OWL Syntax</a>. Class names in Manchester OWL syntax are rendered
using the <tt>rdfs:label</tt> property of the class, and class names
containing a space are surrounded by single quotes.  To query an OWL
class description, type the class description in Manchester OWL syntax
in the query box.  Make sure to select the kind of query: retrieve
subclasses, equivalent classes, or superclasses of the class
description.</p>


<h3 class="api">Downloading Discriptive Logic Queries' Logs</h3>
<p>
  To download the discriptive logic queries' log file, click on this
  <a href="{% url "api-dlquery-logs" %}" target="_blank">link</a><span>.
  The log file is in text format and each log entry is a Json object. Where log entry
  contains information about the query executed, type of query, ontology acronym and time of query execution.
